# Database files
*.db # This will ignore your tracking_log.db file.
# If you ever want to commit the initial empty database schema (but not data),
# you'd need to explicitly git add -f tracking_log.db and then ensure it's empty.
# For now, ignoring it is safer as it contains user data.

# Uploaded files
uploads/ # This will ignore the directory where user attachments are stored.
# NEVER commit user-uploaded files or sensitive data!
